              This Global Data Privacy Policy (Policy) outlines how Chatbot
              Builder collects, processes and uses information in compliance
              with applicable laws and regulations. User’s privacy and the
              confidentiality of the information that the user might obtain
              through or upload on the Chatbot Builder Website or Application
              are priorities for Chatbot Builder.
              <br /> <br />
              Chatbot Builder (“Chatbot Builder”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is
              committed to protecting the privacy of information of identifiable
              individuals who visit the www.Chatbot Builder.co website (the

              If we make any material change to this Policy, we will post the
              revised Policy to this web page and update the “Effective” date
              above to reflect the date on which the revised Policy became

              posting of any amendment to the Privacy Policy shall constitute
              your acceptance of such amendment.
              <br />
              <br /> Personal Data (“PII”) is any information concerning a

              <p>
                This Policy includes the minimum standards for data privacy
                applicable to Chatbot Builder. This Policy is primarily derived
                from the General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) framework.

              <h2>PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</h2>
              <p>
                Chatbot Builder performs the role of a data transmitter during
                the course of business. As a data transmitter, we transmit
                information on behalf of another group company or a third party.
                Chatbot Builder does not process sensitive PII data like credit
                card numbers, social security numbers etc.

            <div className="terms-conditions-para">
              <h2>CHOICE AND CONSENT</h2>
              <p>
                Where required by law, Chatbot Builder obtains consent from
                individuals and uses that consent as the basis for the
                processing of PII, including to collect, use, retain, or
                disclose such data. Individuals are given the choice to opt-in
                or opt-out of this procedure.
                <br /> <br /> For all contact or data forms hosted on Chatbot
                Builder, if required by the user and the law of the concerned
                geography, the user is allowed to add opt-in widgets with clear
                data privacy statements for end user’s reference. When required,
                opt-out widgets can also be added by the user.
                <br /> <br /> Also Chatbot Builder’s double opt-in feature
                allows you to obtain consent from individuals twice, once when
                filling out the form and the second opt-in can be handled via
                email confirmation, where the user receives an email confirming
                their interest in joining your email list.
